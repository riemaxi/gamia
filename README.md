Gamia: AI-Based Team Collaboration Project
Gamia is an AI-based team collaboration project. The main principle guiding this project is MAMBE (Minimum Action, Maximum Benefit).

Player Implementation
The player logic is implemented in the file agent.move.js. The current implementation is basic and does not perform any advanced actions.

Your Task
Define a strategy for the players by either:

Coding it yourself, or
Prompting a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate the strategy.
